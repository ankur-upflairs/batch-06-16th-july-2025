 Assignment: Expense Tracker App (with Local Storage)
🧩 Objective:
Build a simple Expense Tracker web application that allows users to add and delete transactions. The app should use Local Storage to persist data between page reloads.
[{amount,date,description}]
📋 Features to Implement:

User can add an income or expense with:

Description (e.g., "Salary", "Grocery")

Amount (positive = income, negative = expense)

Date - date of transaction 

Display Transactions List

Show all transactions in a list with description and amount.

Delete Transaction

Each transaction should have a delete (❌) button to remove it.

Balance Summary

Total Balance

Total Income

Total Expense

Local Storage Support

Save all transactions to Local Storage

Load from Local Storage on page refresh

💡 Technical Guidelines:
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (no frameworks required)

Organize your code with functions (e.g., for adding, deleting, loading transactions)

Use meaningful variable names and indentation

🗃️ Local Storage Functions (To Help You Get Started):
You can use these examples to work with localStorage:

👉 Save to Local Storage:

localStorage.setItem('transactions', JSON.stringify(transactions));
👉 Get from Local Storage:

const storedTransactions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('transactions')) || [];
👉 Delete from Local Storage:
Just update the list and overwrite it:

function deleteTransaction(id) {
  transactions = transactions.filter(txn => txn.id !== id);
  updateLocalStorage();
}
👉 Update Local Storage Function:

function updateLocalStorage() {
  localStorage.setItem('transactions', JSON.stringify(transactions));
}
